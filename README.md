# Godot4_cell2

I am making a simple game for the researcher's nights (end of September). This is the point that I reach mainly alone, but I realize that I will not have the time to finish it/polish it enough to have an enjoyable game.
The public is small children (5-8 years old), with a game session of 5 minutes or so.
The goal of the game is to launch vesicles to the incoming viruses and avoid these viruses touching the nucleus (game over)


TO CORRECT:
Bug - endless rotation of organelles resulting in their expulsion from the screen - soften, can still happen though


TODO:
Make the option - autoload
Make the translation
Make the fullscreen and maximize
