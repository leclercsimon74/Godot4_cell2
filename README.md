# Godot4_cell2

I am making a simple game for the researcher's nights (end of September). This is the point that I reach mainly alone, but I realize that I will not have the time to finish it/polish it enough to have an enjoyable game.
The public is small children (5-8 years old), with a game session of 5 minutes or so.
The goal of the game is to launch vesicles to the incoming viruses and avoid these viruses touching the nucleus (game over, not made yet)


TOCORRECT:
Bug - Visual: For unknown reason, the vesicle can jump out of the virus after the first Tween (all together). Very likely their point of reference can move
Bug - endless rotation of organelles resulting in their explusion from the screen
Bug - virus does not stop at the membrane

TODO:
Make the Win
Make the Lose
