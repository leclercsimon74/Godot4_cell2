TOCORRECT:
Bug - Visual: For unknown reason, the vesicle can jump out of the virus after the first Tween (all together). Very likely their point of reference can move
Bug - endless rotation of organelles resulting in their explusion from the screen
Bug - virus does not stop at the membrane

Gameplay: Way too much virus! And way too quick!
